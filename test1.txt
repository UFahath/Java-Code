Subject: Request for Assistance

Dear Sir,

I hope this message finds you well. I have completed my courses in Core Java, SQL, and Manual Testing. Basheer Vaba advised me to reach out to you.

My father is currently in Tenkasi, and he will call you once he returns home. I am struggling and would greatly appreciate your assistance. Additionally, I am ready to learn new technologies if needed.

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,
U Abdul Rahuman Fahath
